# SolutionTreeView

This implementation contains a WPF TreeView with add and delete item support. The item can be either of type "file" or of type "directory".

The general idea of this project is to provide a starting point for everyone who wants to create a kind of **Solution Explorer Tree** (thus the project name), like you find one in e.g. Visual Studio.
